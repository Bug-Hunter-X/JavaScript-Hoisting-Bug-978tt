This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to hoisting. The `bug.js` file contains code that exhibits the issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization.  Understanding this behavior is crucial for writing robust JavaScript code.
